#  comment discribe what is happening inside a program

"""
    inline comment
    block comment
    multi-line comment
    single line comment


use the hash (#) symbol to start writing a comment
    # and whitespace character

helps in code review
understand code better
considered a good practice and required for code quality

*By considering the readability of a code,
limit the comment line to a maximum of 79 characters as per the PEP 8 style guide*


    A comment must be short and straightforward, and sensible.
    A comment must add value to your code.
    Comments should contain only information that is relevant to reading and understanding the program.
    You should add comments to give code overviews and
        provide additional information that is not readily available in the code itself.

block comment
    Block comments are used to provide descriptions of files, classes, and functions.
    We should add block comments at the beginning of each file and before each method.
    Add a black line after the block comment to set it apart from the rest of the code.

Docstring comment
    Docstring comments describe Python classes, functions, constructors, methods.
    The docstring comment should appear just after the declaration.
    Although not mandatory, this is highly recommended.

    Conventions for writing good documentation strings are mentioned in PEP 257

    The docstring comment should appear just after the declaration.
    A docstring can be a single line or a multi-line comment.
    Docstring should begin with a capital letter and end with a period.


Summary
    The comments are descriptions that help programmers to understand the functionality of the program.
    Thus, comments are necessary while writing code in Python.

    Use the hash (#) symbol to start writing a comment in Python
    Comments should contain only information that is relevant to reading and understanding the program.
    Python dosenâ€™t support multi-line comments.
        we need to use a hash sign at the beginning of each comment line to make it a multi-line comment
    Keep comments indentation uniform and match for best readability.
    Add Docstring to functions and classes
